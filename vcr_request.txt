We request $500k over 5 years to help establish a broadly based
research initiative aimed at understanding the Cosmic Dawn of our universe.
Several observational probes are beginning to illuminate different aspects of
the formation of the first stars and galaxies, but interpreting these probes
together requires expertise in each observational domain, and a framework of
theory and simulations to combine them. UCB has unique potential, with Quataert
(theory/simulation of galaxy formation and feedback), Kriek (high-redshift
galaxy observations), Weisz (stellar archeology), Holzapfel and Lee (cosmic
microwave background scattering), Seljak (theory of structure formation) and
myself (high-redshift hydrogen tomography) all providing important capabilities
in this area.  The requested funds provide 50% support for 3 postdocs, spaced
over 5 years to work at the fertile intersections of these faculty.  The goal
of this effort is to develop a local collaboration and research framework that
would become a self-sustaining, externally funded center.
